## Components

### Accordion

The outermost wrapper of the accordion. Manages the state of sections and the currently shown side content. Place any
other components as children of this wrapper.

### AccordionSection

An expandable section of the accordion. Inside, you may place elements that alter the section's state of expansion (AccordionSectionHeader) or display information based on this state (AccordionSectionTextContent or custom ones using the AccordionSectionContext). Additionally, a section may contain any number of SideContent components which get rendered inside the Accordion's AccordionSideContentContainer.

### AccordionSectionHeader

A button which, when pressed, changes the expansion status of the accordion section it is placed in.

### AccordionSectionTextContent

The text of a section. Expands/contracts based on the given expansion status of the surrounding section. This is done by controlling the height of the rendered element.

### AccordionSideContentContainer

A container in which all SideContent components contained within all AccordionSections is rendered. Individual elements are wrapped in a container with css class 'active'/'inactive' depending on the expansion state of the section.

### AccordionSideContent

The content to be displayed to the side of the accordion if the parent section is currently expanded.

## Context

### AccordionContext

Context to be consumed by a section component. Passes information on which sections are open, mapping between unique section IDs and their side content, and functions to manipulate this state.

### AccordionSectionContext

Context to be consumed by the children of a section. Passes the unique ID of the section and whether the section is currently expanded or not.

## Styles

To quickly try out this component with some simple transition animations, you may just import the contained example styles:

```jsx
import 'react-side-content-accordion/dist/example.css';
```

For custom styling, you can add your own class names to components as you see fit or base your styles on the class names used by the components (e.g., side-content for SideContent components). If you are using AccordionSectionTextContent, you likely want to include ```overflow: hidden;```. You likely also want to include ```opacity: 0;``` for inactive SideContent (as by default, all SideContent is rendered).
